# ARM Assembly Lab
This repo is my lab to practice and learn ARM assembly from the book [Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-with-64-bit/9781484258811). The code stored in this repo is written by me, but all credit goes to 
the author of the mentioned book. As with all my Labs, this README  contains three sections, ABOUT, MOTIVATION, and BUILDING.

## MOTIVATION
My motivation behind learning assembly comes mainly from my work on the McGillRocket team, where I am in charge of the flight computer software. This system uses a lot of low-level C/C++ code that needs to be optimized. In order to better understand the code compilation, and write code more efficiently, I wanted to learn about how the code worked under the hood. Hence, I decided to learn assembly. 

## BUILDING
This code was tested on a Raspberry Pi 5. To build the assembly, run `./build.sh <FILE_NAME>`. Make sure that the `<FILE_NAME>` doesn't contain the assembly extension (`.s`). You will also need to add the directory to the filename to ensure that the script builds the right one.
